### week 3:

**What did you do last week?**
I set up my leet code account, and looked at one problem. I also examined the largest human connectome dataset. It is to date the largest map of neural connections from an individual human brain ever produced. It has synapse level information and is the biggest publicly available brain map that I am aware of.   

**What do you plan to do this week?**
I want to examine the difficulty of simulating a small piece of the brain map with a graph representation.

**Are there any impediments in your way?**
A lack of information. I think it would be cool to simulate part of an actual human brain as a final project but this could be biting of more than I can chew. I will examine the difficulty more fully now and assess feasibility.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**
I plan on getting more organized, I got distracted working on other classes that I should have taken earlier on in my degree. 

### week 4:
  
**What I did  last week:**
Last week I decided to focus on leetcode for my project. I may still try to mess around with the human brain data on the side, but it was probably too much for one semester with other classes. It would be neat to have a graph representation of one human cortical mini-column by the end of the semester. 

**What do I plan to do this week:**
This week I plan to focus on getting my personal website set up. Once I have that I can start recording my leetcode progress in a digestible format. I also need to catch up on other classes to carve out time specifically dedicated to leetcode. 

**Are there any impediments in my way:** 
The main stumbling block I hit this week was distraction in other classes. I took the first computer systems midterm this week and studying for that occupied the majority of my time. 

**Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better:**
I think that my main goal should be to get caught up in all other classes so that I can schedule a dedicated day for leetcode/ brain analysis. I have also heard that when first starting in leetcode it's wise to memorize some fundamental algorithms and patterns, so that all of your cognitive effort can be focused on permuting them into a specific solution. I started with binary search, and I think I have it mostly memorized. 

### week 5:
 
**What did you do last week?**
Last week I worked on memorizing a few fundamental algorithms for leetcode problems. I have been focusing mainly on binary search problems.

**What do you plan to do this week?**
This week I need to finish my website and continue working on binary search problems. I think I have it pretty much down. I am also going to look at the cortical minicolumn data in the free brain data website. 

**Are there any impediments in your way?**
My main impediment this week is remaining on top of computer systems. So far it has turned out ok but the volume of information is rather large. I also will need to work a decent amount this weekend.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**
I think continuing to schedule will be the most important thing to focus on. I have found that merely starting things early and not necessarily completing them fully gives you much more momentum.

### week 7:

**What did you do last week?**
Last week I prepared for exam two in computer systems and looked into some graph theory stuff when considering cortical columns. I also looked into depth first search more thoroughly for leetcode. I haven't fully memorized it yet but will keep working on that. I also had to turn in the first machine learning project in that class which took quite a while.

**What do you plan to do this week?**
This week I needed to prepare more for exam two in computer systems, which was very time consuming. I also miss-read the timing of the exam and took it in the middle of the night so as not to entirely miss the exam. This week I also need to finish one of the computer systems labs which I anticipate to be difficult.

**Are there any impediments in your way?**
I am getting better at scheduling but it is still difficult to prioritize making real gains on the brain simulation. I think by next week I will have much more time to focus on leetcode progress/ the brain. There appears to be a lull in the intensity of my other two classes in week eight.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**
I think my best strategy is going to be finding a specific day this upcoming week to solely dedicate to my goals in this class. As a side note I have included the link to the brain dataset, it is 1.4 petabytes, which is crazy! https://h01-release.storage.googleapis.com/landing.html 

### week 8:

**What did you do last week?**
Last week I mainly focused on computer systems exam two. I was primarily catching up on that class and a little bit of machine learning.

**What do you plan to do this week?**
This week I have much more time to focus on Leetcode problems, so that will be my primary goal. I am still working on binary search, and DFS easy problems. I plan to continue focusing on that until I feel prepared for more mediums.

**Are there any impediments in your way?**
Not this week.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**
This week I am in a much better time management place, and am mostly caught up on all of my other schoolwork.

### week 9:

**What did you do last week?**
Last week I looked at DFS more in depth. I also found the website algomap.io which seems to be a good free resource for technical interview problems, if anyone else is interested. There is also an associated Youtube channel with good explanations.

**What do you plan to do this week?**
This week I am going to focus on algomap.io problems and continue researching digital models of neural activity.

**Are there any impediments in your way?**
Not so far!

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**
I have a tendency to fall down research rabbit holes. I think remaining focused in one particular area will be critical.  

### week 11:

**What did you do last week?**
Last week I worked on a lab for 2400 and started preparing for the next exam. I also continued with leetcode practice.

**What do you plan to do this week?**
This week I plan to continue working on leetcode, I also found the organization 80,000 hours which gives career advice and I am fine tuning my resume to send to them. If anyone else is interested this is a link to their website: https://80000hours.org/

**Are there any impediments in your way?**
The winter weather seems to have a negative effect on productivity, but not in a major way. It should be mostly straight forward to continue.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**
Last week I was a bit less organized than normal, this week I have all my tasks scheduled and ready to go.

### week 12:

**What did you do last week?**
Last week I worked on leetcode and tuned up my resume to submit to 80,000 hours.

**What do you plan to do this week?**
This week I will have less time to work on leetcode and the brain project. I have a machine learning project and a computer systems exam/ lab due. So I will be directing my attention towards the other classes in a more systematic way. But my hope is that by next week I can talk to the people from 80,000 hours because they supposedly give really good career advice. If anyone has any experience with them let me know.

**Are there any impediments in your way?**
My family has come to stay with me for a week so it has been difficult to maintain a normal schedule. However so far I haven't completely dropped the ball. They will be gone by next week so I will have time to work on the final push of the semester.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**
I think next week there will be less impediments in my way and I can return to normal working conditions.

### week 13:

**What did you do last week?**
Last week I reached out to 80,000 hours and got caught up on the projects and exams in my other classes.

**What do you plan to do this week?**
This week I plan to try and get a head start on the projects and assignments due for the final weeks of the semester so that I will have more time for the final project in this class. I haven't yet heard back from 80,000 hours yet, but am hoping they reach out soon. I think that I will need to put a lot of effort and time into the final report for this class. I am wondering if other students have already started their final reports, and if so what they look like? Also if anyone has had any success in job interviews or other professional success during this class that I might have missed that would be cool to hear about.

**Are there any impediments in your way?**
This week I have been feeling under the weather and it has slowed down my progress, but I am hoping that I start to feel better by the weekend. Other than there aren't too many obstacles in my way.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**
I think maintaining motivation through the final weeks of the semester will be critical. Especially given the holidays and weather conditions in Colorado. It always feels like moving through syrup this time of year, but we are so close to the end. 

### week 14:

**What did you do last week?**
Last week was fall break so I spent most of the week with family. I did less school work than I had planned but so far that has worked out.

**What do you plan to do this week?**
If I do everything right I should be able to have most of my work for the semester done by Friday. I need to finish a homework and final project in ML, and prepare for the final computer systems exam next week. That would leave me with much more time to focus on the final report for this class at the end of this week, and throughout next week. For my final report, I will mostly be discussing my leetcode progress this semester. Recently I have worked more on trees. I tried the "invert a binary tree" question and was amazed at how straight forward the solution was compared to the one I was thinking of. If anyone feels like a leetcode master in this class I am curious how long it took you to get there? In terms of my side project I wont be including the brain project in the final report. However I think I will focus on that full time after graduating. If I could animate it and visualize signal propagation through the network that would be a great portfolio builder. I also have not yet heard back from 80,000 hours. It's supposed to take two weeks but can be up to a month. If I can meet with them by the end of next week and they are helpful I will make a post about it. 

**Are there any impediments in your way?**
Not this week, its the final push of the semester. Although I am curious if others will include visualizations in their reports. I am not sure if it makes sense for me to do that in mine.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**
After the break I feel much more prepared for the final two weeks and ready to get everything done. If I work hard this week I can have a relatively mellow week next week. 



## Fundamental Algorithms for Leetcode:
  
### Binary Search
```python
     def binarySearch(arr, low, high, x):
       while low <= high:
         mid = low + (high - low) // 2
        
         # Check if x is present at mid
         if arr[mid] == x:
           return mid

         # If x is greater, ignore left half
         elif arr[mid] < x:
           low = mid + 1

         # If x is smaller, ignore right half
         else:
           high = mid - 1

       # If we reach here, then the element
       # was not present
       return -1
  ```

### DFS
```python
     def add_edge(adj, s, t):
       # Add edge from vertex s to t
       adj[s].append(t)
       # Due to undirected Graph
       adj[t].append(s)


     def dfs_rec(adj, visited, s):
      # Mark the current vertex as visited
       visited[s] = True

       # Print the current vertex
       print(s, end=" ")

       # Recursively visit all adjacent vertices
       # that are not visited yet
       for i in adj[s]:
         if not visited[i]:
           dfs_rec(adj, visited, i)


     def dfs(adj, s):
       visited = [False] * len(adj)
        # Call the recursive DFS function
        dfs_rec(adj, visited, s)


     if __name__ == "__main__":
        V = 5

       # Create an adjacency list for the graph
        adj = [[] for _ in range(V)]

        # Define the edges of the graph
        edges = [[1, 2], [1, 0], [2, 0], [2, 3], [2, 4]]

        # Populate the adjacency list with edges
        for e in edges:
        add_edge(adj, e[0], e[1])

       source = 1
       print("DFS from source:", source)
       dfs(adj, source)
  ```
